My name is Julia Veras. I am an architect and urban planner with a professional and academic background in technology, currently a Master’s student in Urbanism at FAU-UFBA.

I currently work as a designer-researcher at [Agência Autônoma](https://www.advocacia.autonoma.xyz/), a Brazil-based agency inspired by [Forensic Architecture](https://github.com/forensic-architecture) approaches, where we use design tools as instruments for socio-environmental justice and reparation.

I have a background and strong interest in digital technologies applied to the AEC field, including programming, parametric modeling, digital fabrication, and geospatial analysis (GIS).

I have professional experience developing Rhinoceros plugins in C# and Grasshopper for timber structure simulations. More recently, I developed a web application using AI — a 3D parametric model visualizer built with Three.js.
